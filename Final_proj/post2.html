                <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto">
                    <p>Chung Ching, a third-year student of the Social Work Department of the Hong Kong Baptist
                        University, was unable to successfully comfort her relatives and friends who participated in the
                        "Anti-Extradiction Bill Movement". She interrogated if she could become a qualified social
                        worker in the future.</p>

                    <p>She has an 18-year-old friend who was injured in the front line against the police and was
                        ordered by her family to stop attending any assembly, gatherings and demonstrations. He blamed
                        himself for not being able to participate in the demonstration again. He felt he had forsaken
                        his companions and was full of grief.</p>

                    <p>Chung thought that her knowledge from social work courses should allow her to play the role of
                        social workers. Thus, she tried to ease her friend's anxiety. She attempted to communicate with
                        him with some of the skills she had learned in class. First, she showed understanding to his his
                        thoughts. Then she comforted him without blaming him. She just persuaded him to rest well, and
                        gave him advice to participate in the movements in other ways. Chung said slowly, "standing on
                        the speakers' side, giving support and advice in a gentle tone. These are the counseling skills
                        I learnt in the social work class. I thought this would make him a little better. I thought I
                        was successful at that time."</p>

                    <figure>
                        <img src="img/post2-pic.jpg" height="450" width="700">
                        <figcaption class="text-muted">She felt hopeless and guilty.</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <p>Unexpectedly, Chung was unable to improve his emotions. His friend thought that people around him
                        looked down on him after Chung's comfort. He perceived himself as a burden to front-line
                        protestors and a weakness on the demonstration. His guiltiness deepened and he used cutter to
                        create wounds on arms.</p>

                    <p>Chung felt guilty and thought that she tortured her friend. She wavered her intention to become a
                        social worker. "I have always wanted to be a social worker who strives to help others, but I
                        can't do this. I can't solve the sadness of my familiar friends. I don't have the ability to
                        coach more people. So what qualifications do I have to be a social workers? I should consider
                        quitting this faculty and study other subjects," she said helplessly.</p>
