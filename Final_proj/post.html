          <p>The Anti-Extradition Bill Movement in Hong Kong that began in June has lasted for more than five months,
            and, as the demonstrations have become increasingly intense, social workers have been on the front lines
            mediating between police and demonstrators. Inspired by their example, students preparing for careers in
            social work have set up stations in the streets where they seek to cheer up citizens of Hong Kong and
            counsel those dealing with negative emotions. Some of these would-be social workers said that they felt
            powerless in the face of the protests and unable to apply what they had learned in class to the real-world
            crisis that has gripped the city. Plagued by feelings of loss and self-doubt, they have begun reconsidering
            their plans for the future.</p>

          <p>Li went on to say that she had at first attended the large-scale demonstrations on the weekends and tried
            to communicate with the young protesters on the front lines. She observed that teenagers often behave as if
            they are immortal, being heedless of risks of arrest, injury, or even death. In the face of this “go for
            broke” attitude, Li brought a message of common sense, trying to tell the young people that adults were
            grateful for their passion but worried about what might happen to them, that their parents were waiting for
            them to come home, and that social workers would not abandon them. "However, most of them ignored me and
            rushed to confront the police without a glance back," she recalled with a bitter smile.</p>

            <p>On one occasion, Li went on, she had witnessed police yelling at, chasing, and finally slamming to the
            ground a teenaged protester. Overcome by the brutality of what she had seen, she had been unable to stop
            crying, and she blamed herself for being unable to persuade such youngsters to stay clear of the
            confrontations and violence. "That was the first time I felt that I don’t have what it takes to become a
            social worker." Since then, Li has avoided the demonstrations and has instead been visiting the MTR stations
            in various districts of the city to converse with individuals of all ages. Her desire has been to engage
            with individuals of various social and cultural backgrounds.</p>

            <p>Still, Li admitted that, with regard to her social work studies, the topics of “listening” and "standing
            with listeners" had proven particularly helpful in her efforts to counsel participants in the
            Anti-Extradition Bill Movement. However, the participants in the movement caused her to struggle very much.
            When talking with young people, she said, she tried to listen calmly and to help them to express their
            feelings. She also sought to withhold judgment, whether they were voicing dissatisfaction with the
            government, complaining that family members failed to understand them, or simply expressing their fears. It
            was important to her, she said, that the protesters know that someone was standing by their side ready to
            lend a sympathetic ear.</p>

            <p>Of course, Li had also encountered individuals critical of the protesters. She recalled vividly hearing such
            sentiments as "the protesters deserve to be beaten by the police" and "I hope the police kill them." On
            these occasions, she said, she had found it difficult to contain her anger and resist the urge to curse at
            those who voiced such opinions. Nevertheless, she remained committed to the principle that all individuals
            deserved her attention as a social worker irrespective of their politics and ideas. "Young people have
            feelings just like other people," she told herself every day, forcing herself to try to understand others’
            thoughts and opinions, even those that she found distasteful, and to manage her own discomfort.</p>

            <p>Every time that she heard criticism of the young protesters, Li said, she cried on her way home as she had
            after witnessing the beating of the teenager. Finding herself at one moment standing side-by-side with the
            protesters and at another with the counter-protesters caused her to feel somewhat schizophrenic. Her
            conflicted emotions had left her feeling weak and made it difficult for her to sleep.</p>

            <p>"I would ask myself, if a police officer who abuses his power wants me to talk with him, should I?" Li
            worried that, were she to become a social worker, she would be forced to abandon her principles. Eventually,
            she concluded that she lacked the emotional intelligence to resolve her inner struggles and came to a
            difficult decision: "I will not be a social worker!"</p>
