					<h1>Alarming: Who can save our Mental Health?</h1>
					<p>Pandemic, social unrest, and the rise of the unemployment rate – to name but just a few – several reasons led to the drop of the Hong Kong Mental Health Index in 2020.</p>

									<h2>Feeling Hopeless: Mental sufferings are more serious than physical pain</h2>
									
								</header>
								<hr />
								<p>“Mental stress is even more than physical pain,” said Janet, who was confirmed positive in the test of Covid-19 when she arrived in Hong Kong from the UK. But her sufferings began before her illnesses. </p>

<p>“I faced the dilemma of whether I should put on a mask. If I wear it, I will be discriminated; if I do not, I will get infected.” She described herself as “super nervous” and agonised over the problem for several weeks before coming back to Hong Kong, but it was not eased after her arrival.</p>

<p>Due to the mandatory virus testing scheme, Janet was collected deep throat saliva samples. “I collapsed when I received the call from the doctor.” Without feeling any serious pain, she recalled her distress in the head.</p>

<p>“To a certain extent, I think my emotions even accelerate my physical illnesses.” She mentioned that she was just worrying, but actually, coronavirus poses no effect on her body. </p>

<p>After 40-day hospitalisation, Janet was discharged and returned to her home in Hong Kong. However, her sufferings do not end interiorly. </p>

<p>“Even sneezing due to allergic rhinitis, I worry I will get infected again since the media said that the antibody level drops gradually.” Apart from worrying herself, she wondered how the public views her too. “People seem to be afraid of recovered people. I won’t tell others even if they ask.”  Her psychological impact lasts until now. </p>

<p>She quoted some posts and comments on LIHKG, claiming that people rushing back is to spread the virus in Hong Kong. There was also cyberbullying and doxxing by the netizens.</p>

<p>“I was living in fright all over the year. But who can save me?” She said hopelessly.</p>

							</header>
							<p>A survey conducted by the organizing committee of the annual event “Mental Health Month”, jointly held by rehabilitation institutions and public bodies. They interviewed over 1,000 aged 15 or above Hong Kong citizens from June to July, for asking the impact imposed on their mental health by the personal and social factors and their ways to cope with the problems.</p>
 
										<p>According to the WHO-5 questionnaire, anyone who scores lower than 52 is considered a failure, which is an acceptable level agreed by scholars. Over half of the interviewees fail in the health index, which is alarming.

							<p>People always concern physical health problems under COVID-19, but they neglect the mental health issues of people. Both parents and ordinary citizens suffer mentally in this pandemic. According to the studies, it states that one-third of the interviewees suffer from different mental problems. The reason is not only the pandemic but also the social situation in Hong Kong last year. Though the mark of mental health rises slightly this year, it is still not passing. It is the third consecutive year that the mark has failed.</p>

										<h2>Case 2</h2>
									</header>
									<hr />
									<p>“I’ve underestimated the impact of the social event.” said an 18-year-old girl, who participated in the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement since June 2019.</p>

									<p>Due to security, she was not willing to disclose her identity. “I participate in demonstrations. They were very peaceful, and the protesters were all very calm. However, the situation turned worse.”</p>
									
									<p>Although she did not witness someone being killed, she recalled the scene where her friends were being arrested and injured. “I can do nothing but to cry.” It does not limit to her physical experience, heard the news from social media also made her heartbroken. </p>
									
									<p>“I can’t stop crying while watching the live video in Yuen Long on 21st July. The same situation happened when I read the news of Prince Edward MTR station.” Then, she started to realise she has psychological problems.” It is getting more serious when the temper escalates.”</p>
									
									<p>Apart from crying, she told that she was always standing in front of the car park where Chow Tsz-Lok died, without any purpose. “During leisure time, I always warrender around in Tseung Kwan O because I live there. I found that I always can't control my feet to walk there.”</p>
									
									<p>“I talked to my fellows, and some of them share the same experience as me.” Her friends suggested she seek professional consultations, but she rejected. “I have once entered the consultation room, but I just can’t voice out my real emotions. I was scared that the doctor would reveal my identity to the Police.” Because of the failure of the first experience, she refused to go there again. Therefore, there is no follow-up action. The symptoms lasted until now and she still had insomnia for some days.</p>
									
									<p>It is common to see that victims tend to be showing less trust in the Police and the older generation due to different political stances. </p>
									
									<p>“I was thinking: if there were no protests and pandemic, I would have just entered the university. What will be a normal university student life?”</p>
