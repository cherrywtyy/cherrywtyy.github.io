							<h2>Feeling Hopeless: Mental sufferings are more serious than physical pain</h2>

						</header>
						<hr />
						<p>“Mental stress is even more serious than physical pain,” said Janet, who was confirmed positive in
							the test of Covid-19 when she arrived in Hong Kong from the UK. But her sufferings began
							before her illnesses. </p>

						<p>“I faced the dilemma of whether I should put on a mask. If I wear it, I will be
							discriminated; if I do not, I will get infected.” She described herself as “super nervous”
							and agonised over the problem for several weeks before coming back to Hong Kong, but it was
							not eased after her arrival.</p>

						<p>Due to the mandatory virus testing scheme, Janet was collected deep throat saliva samples. “I
							collapsed when I received the call from the doctor.” Without feeling any serious pain, she
							recalled her distress in the head.</p>

						<p>“To a certain extent, I think my emotions even accelerate my physical illnesses.” She
							mentioned that she was just worrying, but actually, coronavirus poses no effect on her body.
						</p>

						<p>After 40-day hospitalisation, Janet was discharged and returned to her home in Hong Kong.
							However, her sufferings do not end interiorly. </p>

						<p>“Even sneezing due to allergic rhinitis, I worry I will get infected again since the media
							said that the antibody level drops gradually.” Apart from worrying herself, she wondered how
							the public views her too. “People seem to be afraid of recovered people. I won’t tell others
							even if they ask.” Her psychological impact lasts until now. </p>

						<p>She quoted some posts and comments on LIHKG, claiming that people rushing back is to spread
							the virus in Hong Kong. There was also cyberbullying and doxxing by the netizens.</p>
						<img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="LIHKG post" style="height:200px;width:450px" class="center">
						<p style="text-align:center; font-size:80%;">A comment quoted from LIHKG, which is a forum in Hong Kong. The post is using foul language to blame the people coming from Britain is posing a threat to Hongkongers. He claimed that Britain is like a “Wuhan 3.0”. He also cited a news article talking about there being a chartered airplane in Vietnam to bring back a daughter from European countries.

						<p>“I was living in fright all over the year. But who can save me?” She said hopelessly.</p>

				</header>
				<p>A survey conducted by the organizing committee of the annual event “Mental Health Month”, jointly
					held by rehabilitation institutions and public bodies. They interviewed over 1,000 aged 15 or above
					Hong Kong citizens from June to July, for asking the impact imposed on their mental health by the
					personal and social factors and their ways to cope with the problems.</p>

				<p>According to the WHO-5 questionnaire, anyone who scores lower than 52 is considered a failure, which
					is an acceptable level agreed by scholars. Over half of the interviewees fail in the health index,
					which is alarming.
				</p>
				<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="0c745a55-a462-4905-8935-4a3ff26eb5d1" data-type="interactive"

					<br></div>
					<p>On average, Hongkongers scored 45.12 out of 100 in the mid-2020, down from 46.41 in 2019 and plunging further below the acceptable level. Although the score increased slighly in the middle of 2020, the average score is still the lowest among all nine consecutive years since the years began. </p>
				<p>People always concern physical health problems under COVID-19, but they neglect the mental health
					issues of people. Both parents and ordinary citizens suffer mentally in this pandemic. According to
					the studies, it states that one-third of the interviewees suffer from different mental problems. The
					reason is not only the pandemic but also the social situation in Hong Kong last year. Though the
					mark of mental health rises slightly this year, it is still not passing the acceptance level. It is the third consecutive
					year that the mark has failed. The scores drop every year as shown in the graph.</p>

				<p>It is also suggested that the pandemic poses negative consequences in Hongkongers. More than 75% of
					the interviewees claim that the pandemic imposed negative effects.</p>

							<h2>Secondary school girl experienced mental illness after participating in protests</h2>
						</header>
						<hr />
						<p>“I’ve underestimated the impact of the social event.” said an 18-year-old girl, who
							participated in the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement since June 2019.</p>

						<p>Due to security, she was not willing to disclose her identity. “I participate in
							demonstrations. They were very peaceful, and the protesters were all very calm. However, the
							situation turned worse.”</p>

						<p>Although she did not witness someone being killed, she recalled the scene where her friends
							were being arrested and injured. “I can do nothing but to cry.” It does not limit to her
							physical experience, heard the news from social media also made her heartbroken. </p>

						<p>“I can’t stop crying while watching the live video in Yuen Long on 21st July. The same
							situation happened when I read the news of Prince Edward MTR station.” Then, she started to
							realise she has psychological problems.” It is getting more serious when the temper
							escalates.”</p>

						<p>Apart from crying, she told that she was always standing in front of the car park where Chow
							Tsz-Lok died, without any purpose. “During leisure time, I always warrender around in Tseung
							Kwan O because I live there. I found that I always can't control my feet to walk there.”</p>

						<p>“I talked to my fellows, and some of them share the same experience as me.” Her friends
							suggested she seek professional consultations, but she rejected. “I have once entered the
							consultation room, but I just can’t voice out my real emotions. I was scared that the doctor
							would reveal my identity to the Police.” Because of the failure of the first experience, she
							refused to go there again. Therefore, there is no follow-up action. The symptoms lasted
							until now and she still had insomnia for some days.</p>

						<p>It is common to see that victims tend to be showing less trust in the Police and the older
							generation due to different political stances. </p>

						<p>“I was thinking: if there were no protests and pandemic, I would have just entered the
							university. What will be a normal university student life?”</p>

								<p>“I believe there are lots of (mental) services provided for the needy, but the problem is no one knows,” said Dr Wong Sau Ming, Corine, the Co-opt Member of Taskforce on Epidemiology Study of PTSD, Division of Clinical Psychology at The Hong Kong Psychological Society.</p>
								<p>She commented the event promoting mental health is lacking in popularity. “There’s not enough promotion, which led to low participation in the activities. People who really need help (internally) may not find them (the advisory bodies).” </p>

						  <p>She suggested another reason for low participation, “the patients may hesitate because of having some concerns or struggles for certain reasons. Nevertheless, when they decided to seek help, the event had already ended.”  </p>
						  
						  <p>When asked about what the government did in order to promote psychological health, she raised the “Shall We Talk” campaign launched by the Advisory Committee on Mental Health. It aims to provide mental health information, community help and suggestions for the public. </p>

						  <p>“However, this campaign serves the public in general but not targeting a specific group of people.” She did not know much about the government’s action in tackling the mental illness raised by social unrest and pandemic.</p>
						  
						  <p>Some non-organizations, such as The Hong Kong Council of Social Service and the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Group had tailor-made services for young people that suffered from mental illness during the protest. However, these services turned down because of lack of resources and the concern raised by the pandemic.” She said regretfully.</p>
						  
						  <p>Apart from seeking professional help, she suggested that teenagers can improve their mealth health through lifestyle modification, which involves developing long-term habits and maintaining new behaviour for years. </p>

						<p>Mental Health Month is an annual event in October, that is jointly organized by
							rehabilitation groups and public bodies, including Joyful (Mental Health) Foundation. </p>

							<img src="https://scontent.fhkg10-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/119020269_2616080938615544_3447971694827889292_o.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=2&_nc_sid=730e14&_nc_ohc=8anhPtgdzJgAX9YIi7v&_nc_ht=scontent.fhkg10-1.fna&oh=884ef96164d3c6e53fb814600f4c28a1&oe=5FEDFB28"

						<p>This year theme is “RE: Mind”, symbolizing citizens have to stop and care for their physical
							and mental health, to calm their mind and improve their health. It represents different
							meanings individually. “Remind” stands for recalling someone to remember something; “RE”
							stands for a restart and reply; “:” stands for stop and explanation, and “Mind” stands for
							consciousness and thoughts. </p>

						<p>In order to improve the mental health of citizens, Joyful (Mental Health) Foundation urged
							the government and related bodies to set up regulations and strategies in multiple ways.
							Apart from the government, schooling is an integral part of handling the problem. For
							example, teachers and school-based social workers have to identify students who necessitate
							consultations. It can minimize the pressure of students during school time. </p>

						<p>According to Martin E. Seligman, he proposed positive psychology, which suggests seven ways
							for people to keep in positive emotions, such as praise people in surroundings, do more
							exercise, discuss with family members more often, and satisfy with their jobs. </p>

						<p>The spokesperson of the organization also claimed that the survey helps to monitor the mental
							health index of Hongkongers, which allows a better understanding of different parties to
							come up with their policies.</p>
